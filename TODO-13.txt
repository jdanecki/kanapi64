Add directory for .cmake files (the same that is already done for .pc files)
Add directory for application icons (.png, .svg, .desktop already is partly supported)
Cross-directory dependencies (package from app will require another package from cli)
Release KaNaPi 13 AND KaNaPi 12 as chroot (instead of docker)
Fully switch from dockers to chroots.
Pull some apps out of cli. Create a cli-base and cli-apps. cli-base (with sbs and bbs) will be distributed as a minimal chroot (and release).
Perhaps distribute gui chroot/image.
Consider rolling-release model for apps.
Move xapps from x11 to apps (or create a new directory with xapps).
Fully migrate all packages related to sound to the sound directory.
Consider wayland.
Build gtk+3 with gobject and introspection support.
Perhaps split apps to apps and libs.
Consider firefox.
Consider rust (using rustup ecosystem).
Documentation
Obsolete `pkg` or host new binary packages.
Consider testsystem with chroots (pulls cli-base, tries to install package, display failures)
fix mesa issues (change buildtype to release, to avoid asserts)
Add python packages directory with pip packages
Fix ./configure running ./configure on deps instead of ./install
